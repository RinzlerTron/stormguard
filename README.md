## 🚀 One-Click Deploy

**Prerequisites:**
- AWS account with Amazon Bedrock access
- Claude Sonnet 3.5 model enabled in your region
- AWS SAM CLI installed ([install guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/install-sam-cli.html))

**Deploy in 2 commands:**

```bash
sam build --use-container
sam deploy --guided
```

After deployment, open the Lambda Function URL from the CloudFormation outputs to see the demo.

## Problem Statement

See [docs/ABOUT.md](docs/ABOUT.md) for full problem statement and solution overview.

**Hurricane Milton (October 2024):**
- $50B+ in losses
- Service levels dropped to 60%
- 48+ hours of manual coordination
- Critical stockouts across affected regions

**Manual supply chain coordination fails during disasters.**

---

## The Solution

Six autonomous AI agents coordinate in real-time using Amazon Bedrock:

1. **Demand Intelligence** 🧠 - Forecasts demand surges for critical products
2. **Inventory Optimizer** 📊 - Identifies stores at stockout risk
3. **Procurement** 📦 - Creates emergency orders autonomously
4. **Price Stability** 💰 - Prevents price gouging (0% increase enforced)
5. **Risk & Compliance** 🛡️ - Validates decisions, triggers governance review
6. **Orchestrator** ⚡ - Synthesizes everything into executive recommendations

**Result:** 94% service level maintained vs 60% baseline, $6.8M revenue protected

## Key Features

### Autonomous Operations Mode
Watch 6 agents coordinate in real-time - activity stream + visual flow diagram

### Test Scenarios Mode
Run AI scenarios with live Bedrock API calls - tropical storms, winter storms, hurricanes

### Human-in-the-Loop Governance
High-stakes decisions (>$500K) require executive approval with crisis justification

### Data Transformation Pipeline
Every agent shows data input, key insight, and metrics - complete transparency

True multi-agent coordination - each agent builds on previous agent's output.
