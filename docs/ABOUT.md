# About StormGuard

## The Problem

Hurricane Milton (October 2024) exposed critical supply chain vulnerabilities:
- **$50B+ in losses** across affected regions
- **Service levels dropped to 60%** (vs 95% normal)
- **48+ hours of manual coordination** by exhausted managers
- **Critical stockouts** (water, batteries, medical supplies)
- **Price gouging** by competitors (300%+ increases reported)

This pattern repeats with every major disruption: hurricanes, winter storms, wildfires, port closures, pandemics.

## The Solution

StormGuard is an autonomous multi-agent AI system that coordinates supply chain decisions during natural disasters. Six specialized AI agents work together using **Amazon Bedrock (Claude Sonnet 3.5)** to make real-time decisions:

### The 6 Agents

1. **Demand Intelligence Agent** 🧠
   - Forecasts demand surges based on event severity
   - Analyzes sales transaction patterns
   - Predicts spikes in critical products

2. **Inventory Optimizer Agent** 📊
   - Identifies stores at stockout risk
   - Calculates optimal reorder quantities
   - Prioritizes high-impact locations

3. **Procurement Agent** 📦
   - Creates emergency purchase orders
   - Selects vendors and quantities
   - Operates within budget constraints

4. **Price Stability & Anti-Gouging Agent** 💰
   - Prevents price increases during crisis
   - Maintains ethical pricing (0% increase policy)
   - Monitors competitors for gouging violations

5. **Risk & Compliance Agent** 🛡️
   - Validates all decisions against policy
   - Triggers governance review for high-stakes decisions
   - Maintains audit trail

6. **Orchestrator Agent** ⚡
   - Coordinates all agents
   - Synthesizes results into executive summary
   - Calculates business impact metrics

## How It Works

### Two-Mode Interface

**Autonomous Operations Mode:**
- Visual demonstration of agent coordination
- Real-time activity stream
- Flow diagram showing agent communication

**Test Scenarios Mode:**
- Live Amazon Bedrock API calls
- Actual AI reasoning and decision-making
- Data transformation pipeline visible
- Human-in-the-loop governance for high-stakes decisions

### Human-in-the-Loop Governance

When procurement spend exceeds thresholds, the system triggers governance review with crisis justification displayed for executive approval or rejection.

## Technology

Built entirely on AWS serverless:
- **Amazon Bedrock** - Claude Sonnet 3.5 for AI reasoning
- **AWS Lambda** - Python 3.12 serverless execution
- **Amazon S3** - CSV data storage
- **Lambda Function URL** - Public HTTPS endpoint

## Ethical AI Principles

### 1. Anti-Gouging Enforcement
Price Stability Agent prevents price increases during disasters with 0% price adjustment policy on essentials.

### 2. Transparency
All decisions fully explainable with data inputs visible, reasoning documented, and audit trail maintained.

### 3. Human Oversight
High-stakes decisions require approval with governance review modal and rejection handling.

### 4. No Discrimination
Decisions based purely on demand forecasts, inventory levels, and supply constraints.
