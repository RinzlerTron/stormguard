# StormGuard Architecture

## Innovation: Why Multi-Agent?

Traditional supply chain AI uses a single model to make all decisions. This fails during disasters because:
- One model can't be expert in forecasting AND pricing AND procurement
- No verification or governance built in
- Black box decisions with no transparency

**StormGuard uses 6 specialized agents that coordinate autonomously** - mimicking how real supply chain teams work, but at machine speed.

## AWS Service Architecture

### Core Services

**Amazon Bedrock**
- Powers all 6 AI agents with Claude Sonnet 3.5
- Handles natural language reasoning and decision-making
- Agents: Demand Intelligence, Inventory Optimizer, Procurement, Pricing, Risk & Compliance, Orchestrator

**AWS Lambda**
- Serverless execution environment (Python 3.12)
- Hosts all agent logic and coordination
- Serves embedded web interface
- 5-minute timeout for agent processing

**Amazon S3**
- Stores supply chain data (sales history, store inventory, product catalog)
- CSV format for transparency and auditability

**Lambda Function URL**
- Public HTTPS endpoint for demo access
- Direct invocation without API Gateway

## Agent Flow

```
Event Detected → Orchestrator Agent (Bedrock)
    ↓
Demand Intelligence Agent (Bedrock) → Analyzes S3 data
    ↓
Inventory Optimizer Agent (Bedrock) → Processes demand forecast
    ↓
Procurement Agent (Bedrock) → Creates purchase orders
    ↓
Pricing Agent (Bedrock) → Validates ethical pricing
    ↓
Risk & Compliance Agent (Bedrock) → Checks thresholds
    ↓
[If needed] Human Governance Review
    ↓
Orchestrator Agent (Bedrock) → Synthesizes final result
```

Each agent is powered by Amazon Bedrock with specialized prompting for its domain expertise.

## Agent Specialization

**Demand Intelligence** 🧠
- Uses Bedrock for time series forecasting
- Analyzes historical sales data from S3
- Cannot make procurement decisions (separation of duties)

**Inventory Optimizer** 📊
- Uses Bedrock for reorder point calculations
- Cannot forecast demand (requires Demand Agent output)

**Procurement** 📦
- Uses Bedrock for vendor selection and ordering
- Cannot validate compliance (requires Risk Agent)

**Price Stability** 💰
- Uses Bedrock for ethical pricing enforcement
- Cannot approve large expenditures

**Risk & Compliance** 🛡️
- Uses Bedrock for policy validation
- Triggers human governance when thresholds exceeded
- Cannot make business decisions

**Orchestrator** ⚡
- Uses Bedrock to coordinate all agents
- Synthesizes outputs into executive summary
- Cannot execute individual agent tasks

This specialization prevents errors - no single agent can both create a $650K purchase order AND approve it.

## Human-in-the-Loop Governance

When Risk Agent detects high-stakes decisions:
- Procurement spend exceeds threshold
- Price increase above acceptable range
- Unvetted vendor usage

System pauses and displays crisis justification to executive for approval/rejection decision.

---

## Data Pipeline

Each agent transforms data for the next agent in sequence:

S3 CSV data → Demand forecast → Inventory requirements → Procurement plan → Risk assessment → Executive summary

All powered by Amazon Bedrock agents with Lambda orchestration.

## Why This Architecture Wins

### Innovation
✓ Multi-agent coordination (not single LLM)
✓ Sequential data dependencies (not parallel calls)
✓ Specialized expertise per agent
✓ Built-in governance and transparency

### Technical Complexity
✓ 6 agents with distinct Bedrock prompting strategies
✓ Data transformation pipeline across agents
✓ Dynamic scenario handling
✓ Human-in-the-loop with justification
✓ Rejection handling with audit trail

### Business Value
✓ Real-world problem ($50B+ losses per hurricane)
✓ Measurable impact (94% vs 60% service level)
✓ Ethical AI (anti-gouging enforcement)
✓ Production-ready for retail chains
